"""Leap year checker.

This module provides a single function `is_leap_year(year)` which returns
True when `year` is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
"""

def is_leap_year(year):
	"""Return True if `year` is a leap year (Gregorian rules).

	Rules:
	- divisible by 4 -> leap year
	- divisible by 100 -> not a leap year, unless also divisible by 400

	Parameters
	----------
	year : int
		Year number (must be integer >= 1)

	Returns
	-------
	bool
		True if `year` is a leap year, False otherwise.

	Raises
	------
	TypeError
		If `year` is not an int.
	ValueError
		If `year` is less than 1.

	One-line explanation: divisible by 4 but years divisible by 100 are
	excluded unless divisible by 400.
